When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	I'd want to use a remote repository instead of keeping all my work local because this makes it easy for people to see the work that I'd want public. It also helps in collaboration when everyone's working off the same accepted and stable base.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
